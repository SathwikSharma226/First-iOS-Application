# First-iOS-Application
This is my first iOS application. A simple colour chnaging single view application

Started off with iOS and Swift 5 development, this is a very simple project buildt to understnad the storyboard and objects of UIKit provided by Swift. It might seem like the application is way too very simple but this is where it all starts.
